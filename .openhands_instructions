# OpenHands Instructions

- When making changes to solve an issue, provide detailed information about the changes made, including the files modified and the purpose of each change.
- Ensure that all changes to application code are accompanied by appropriate tests in the testing directory.
- Run the tests after making changes to confirm that the issue has been resolved.
- If the changes involve only documentation or configuration files, new tests are not required.
- Do not ask for human help; interact only with the provided environment.
